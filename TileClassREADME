KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE TILE CLASS AS IT IS 21OCT19
-gotta have guava package installed to use things like immutableMap
-Probably need another sub-class for the king's throne tile.
-The dimension of the board is declared in here right now.  It will need to be moved over to the controller class once it's created.
